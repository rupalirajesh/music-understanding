# PROJECT STATE — the everything doc (pick-up-where-we-left-off)

Last updated: 2026-07-18. Update this whenever anything changes hands.

## Machines & workflow
- **Laptop** (no GPU): stimulus synthesis, API evals, scoring/analysis,
  stimulus auditing by ear, manual response verification.
- **H100 box**: open-model runs, activation extraction/probing, generation
  battery; outputs are committed back to `results/` and pushed.
- Repo: https://github.com/rupalirajesh/music-understanding (PUBLIC — keep
  docs free of personal details).

## What exists (all pushed, commit a6ae042 + later)
- `RESEARCH_PLAN.md` — full background primer + study design (L1/L2/L3,
  tracks A/B/C, hypotheses H1–H6). Read Part 0 first.
- `experiments/TASKS.md` — the tier list: every task, N, controls, what a
  pass/fail means, sample-size rationale.
- `experiments/musicprobe/` — package: generators, manifest, prompts (3
  paraphrases + diagnostic distractors), jobs (controls), runners (API +
  H100 local), scoring (accuracy/audio_gain/confusions/psychometrics), DSP
  L1 baselines.
- `experiments/manifests/` — FROZEN battery v1: 1,176 stimuli / 2,063 jobs.
  Do not regenerate while v1 runs are in flight; changes = v2.
- `experiments/gpu/` — Track B: activation extraction (MERT/Whisper/CLAP
  loaders done; AF3/Qwen-Omni TODO) + held-out-soundfont linear probes.
- `experiments/genmodel/` — MusicGen constraint battery + DSP adherence
  scoring; single-constraint rule; vocab-vs-theory pairs. Not yet run.
- `experiments/scripts/` — 00 soundfonts, 01 generate (seeded, machine-
  stable), 02 jobs, 03 listening page, 04 review export, 05 self-test
  (14 checks, ALL PASSING as of 2026-07-18).
- Docs workflow: a local read-this inbox file (not in git, cleared
  iteratively), `PAPER.md` (results skeleton), this file (state).

## Status of runs
| What | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen2-Audio-7B full battery | H100 box | done EXCEPT ~350 no-audio jobs (NaN bug, fixed 70fd14f) — needs pull + rerun to backfill |
| Gemini battery | H100 box | was stuck (timeout added in fix), rerunning |
| GPT-4o-audio | — | not started |
| MERT/Whisper/CLAP extraction + probes | H100 box | not started |
| MusicGen battery | H100 box | not started |
| AF3 / Music Flamingo loaders | code | TODO (needs NVIDIA repo code) |
| Qwen2-Audio published-number replication | — | TODO; pick exact benchmark subset first |

## Decisions made (and why) — chronological
1. Only fine-tuning is feasible (no pretraining budget); the study's job is
   to find WHERE fine-tuning helps (alignment/data gaps) vs can't (encoder).
2. Test generation models too — may end up fine-tuning one. Understanding
   measured as constraint adherence scored by our own DSP.
3. Synthetic stimuli for Tiers 1–2 (unlimited N, perfect ground truth,
   factor control); real datasets only for Tier 3.
4. Meter task = beats-per-bar (audio can't convey notated denominator —
   caught in stimulus audit). 3/4-vs-6/8 grouping task specced separately.
5. Key task "cadence" form renamed "progression" (it's not cadence-type ID);
   cadence_type specced as future task 2.6.
6. tuning_judgment added (12-TET grid probe, behavioral half).
7. All responses stored verbatim; response-level verification is done
   manually (review CSVs + explanations.csv). Never trust auto-parse alone.
8. Single-constraint generation prompts only; compound later.
9. WAVs/soundfonts not in git; regeneration is deterministic (stable crc32
   seeding — NEVER use builtin hash() for seeds).
10. Battery v1 frozen at 2,063 jobs. Ladder arm will be battery v2.
11. NEW DIRECTION (2026-07-18): representation ladder → universal
    music representation → world-model framing. 5 requirements: inferable
    from audio / token-compact / sufficient for battery / human-readable /
    genre-universal incl. continuous pitch (staff notation fails #5; that's
    the Carnatic module's future role as stress test).

## Next actions (ordered)
1. GPU box: pull, `scripts/05_selftest.py`, rerun Qwen (backfills no-audio),
   restart Gemini, `--limit 20` pilot before any new full run, export
   review CSVs, push results/.
2. Local/by-ear: audit mode stimuli; when results land, explanations.csv
   analysis + spot-check review CSVs against audio.
3. Next build: ladder arm (battery v2) — L1 features into prompts at
   one-abstraction-below-answer, features-only + few-shot variants; keep
   v1 job_ids untouched.
4. Then: scoring notebook/report generator for the capability heatmap and
   psychometric plots once ≥2 models have results.
5. Then: MERT extraction + probes (first L2/L3 dissociation), Qwen2-Audio
   replication number, MusicGen battery.

## Known gaps / honesty list
- L1 key detection weak on minor progressions (naive Krumhansl) — use
  essentia on GPU box before making L1 claims about cadence-form stimuli.
- Mode melodies are random diatonic walks — musician-composed melodies
  would be better stimuli (planned).
- Real Gemini/OpenAI payload paths and Qwen loading only testable on the
  GPU box (self-test covers everything else).
- Explain-format responses can be confabulated — evidence, not proof.
- progression_id has only 32 stimuli (small N — hypothesis-generating only).
- Contamination: synthetic stimuli are safe, but Tier 3 datasets are public.
